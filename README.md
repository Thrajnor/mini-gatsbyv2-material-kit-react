# mini-gatsbyv2-material-kit-react
Minimalistic project exposing gatsby v2 + material-kit-react compatibility problems 

to make this work, you need to 
1. make gatsby v2 project
2. run npm install
3. add gatsby-plugin-resolve-src in 'next' version
4. add react-router-dom
5. add @material-ui/core and @material-ui/icons
6. add classnames
7. copy components and assets form material-kit-react

this should make groundwork for any material-kit-react project in development mode

this setup still doesn't work in prod unfortunetly
